    <h1>The Chrysanthemum</h1>

    <div class="contain">
        <p>Chrysanthemums (/krɪˈsænθəməm/), sometimes called mums or chrysanths,[5] are flowering plants of the genus Chrysanthemum in the family Asteraceae.[4] They are native to East Asia and northeastern Europe. Most species originate from East Asia and the center of diversity is in China.[6] Countless horticultural varieties and cultivars exist.</p>

        <p>The compound inflorescence is an array of several flower heads, or sometimes a solitary head. The head has a base covered in layers of phyllaries. The simple row of ray florets is white, yellow, or red. The disc florets are yellow. Pollen grains are approximately 34 microns.[citation needed]
        The fruit is a ribbed achene.</p>

        Pollen
        The genus Chrysanthemum are perennial herbaceous flowering plants, sometimes subshrubs. The leaves are alternate, divided into leaflets and may be pinnatisect, lobed, or serrate (toothed) but rarely entire; they are connected to stalks with hairy bases.[7]

        Etymology[edit]
        The name "chrysanthemum" is derived from the Ancient Greek: χρυσός chrysos (gold) and Ancient Greek: ἄνθεμον anthemon (flower).[9][10]

        The genus Chrysanthemum was first formally described by Linnaeus in 1753, with 14 species, and hence bears his name (L.) as the botanical authority.[11] The genus once included more species, but was split several decades ago[when?] into several genera, putting the economically important florist's chrysanthemums in the genus Dendranthema. The naming of these genera has been contentious, but a ruling of the International Botanical Congress in 1999 changed the defining species of the genus to Chrysanthemum indicum, restoring the florist's chrysanthemums to the genus Chrysanthemum.[citation needed]
        Genera now separated from Chrysanthemum include Argyranthemum, Glebionis, Leucanthemopsis, Leucanthemum, Rhodanthemum, and Tanacetum
        Chrysanthemums (Chinese: 菊花; pinyin: Júhuā) were first cultivated in China as a flowering herb as far back as the 15th century BC.[13] Over 500 cultivars had been recorded by 1630.[8] By 2014 it was estimated that there were over 20,000 cultivars in the world and about 7,000 cultivars in China.[14] The plant is renowned as one of the Four Gentlemen (四君子) in Chinese and East Asian Art. The plant is particularly significant during the Double Ninth Festival.[citation needed]
